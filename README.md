# PSO Baselines

Hhigh quality implementations of PSO variations in Python, organized by application, with tools to compare performance on benchmark functions and build intuition. 

## Algorithms
### Single Objective 

* Local Best PSO ([LBEST_PSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/pso))
* Global Best PSO ([GBEST_PSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/pso))
* Unified PSO ([UPSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/upso))
* Dynamic Multi-Swarm PSO ([DMSPSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/dmspso))

### Multi Objective

* Dynamic Neighborhood ([DNPSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/dnpso))

## Benchmark Functions

Single objective test functions:
* Sphere Function
* Rosenbrock's Function
* Ackley's Function
* Griewank's Function
* Rastrigin's Function
* Weierstrass Function

Multi objective test functions:
* Lis & Eiben
* Zitzler

## Tools

* **Test Runner** - select algorithms to compare mean performance and convergence time
* **Animations** - watch animations of search behavior for each algorithm, and compare movement patterns across algorithms

## Collaborators welcome
