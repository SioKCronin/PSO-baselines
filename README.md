# PSO Baselines

This repo is dedicated to providing high quality implementations of PSO variations in Python, organized by their application. I have included a wide variety of algorithms in order to highlight how stochastic process is levarated in optimization, and to enable researchers to compare variations directly on benchmark functions. 

## Algorithms
### Single Objective 

* Local Best PSO ([LBEST_PSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/pso))
* Global Best PSO ([GBEST_PSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/pso))
* Unified PSO ([UPSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/upso))
* Dynamic Multi-Swarm PSO ([DMSPSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/dmspso))

### Multi Objective

* Dynamic Neighborhood ([DNPSO](https://github.com/SioKCronin/PSO-baselines/tree/master/dnpso))

## Benchmark Functions

Single objective test functions:
* Sphere Function
* Rosenbrock's Function
* Ackley's Function
* Griewank's Function
* Rastrigin's Function
* Weierstrass Function

Multi objective test functions:
* Lis & Eiben
* Zitzler

## Help wanted

Do you have a favorite PSO variation not implemented here that you'd like to see? Is there analytics or specifics visualizations that would help you understand nuances of these algorithms? Drop me a line and let's collaborate!
