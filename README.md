# Swarm Reinforcement Learning

Can swarm optimization improve upon Q-learning in a classic RL problem? If so, which variation? (prepare yourself for an onlsaught of acroynyms)

## CartPole

* Deep Q-learning (after Keon)
* Traditional PSO
* MS-PSO (Chow & Tsui)
* MLPS (Wang, Yang & Chen) 
* DMS-PSO (Liang & Suganthan)
* SRL-PSOs (Iima & Kuroe)

## Tuning enhancements

* Gridsearch & RandomSearch for PSO tuning
* PPSO (Nobiile, Pasi & Cazzaniga)

## Questions

* What about the nature of this project would lead us to suspect one method over another?
* Why might we be seeing the performance we're seeing?
* Are our metrics effectively capturing the learning rate/timecourse of learning?
* What other RL problems should we try these on?
* Any other notable PSO variants we should consider?
* How to best measure performance (mean and sd of performance?)
