# Swarm Lab

This project is motivated by a desire to connect academic swarm intelligence research with the developer community. The backbone of Swarm Lab is a collection of high quality implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms in Python, organized by application. We also plan to add visualization tools and a broader suite of real-world inspired testing functions to support ideation and development of new algorithms.

Swarm intelligences algorithms leverage global population-based search solutions to balance exploration with exploitation with respect to specified cost functions (or functions, in the multi-objective cases). The particle swarm optimization (PSO) lineage was sparked by Eberhart and Kennedy in their original paper on PSOs in 1995, and the intervening years have seen many variations spring forth from the central idea of distributing search across multiple agents. I think this is a nice place to start, as these approaches are easy to understand and fiddle with.
