# Unified PSO

## Unique Contribution
* Combines global and local best into a single algorithm.
* Includes the addition of a stochastically mutated scalar constant to
either Global or Local velocity updates.

## Performance

Twenty experiments were run for each function. Reported results were the
percentage of runs that achieved the success goal, and the mean of the
function evaluations required to achieve success.
