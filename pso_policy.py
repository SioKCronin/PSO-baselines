# Particle Swarm Optimization Policy

# At each time t the sytem is described by its state s
# The agent's action a is represented by a vector of I different control params
# The state + action yields the new state and a reward

# Bounded by the lower and upper bounds of the control params (what are these
# for the benchmarks?

# Simulated reward is weighte by y^k where y is 0-1
# This is the discount factor (is it the range or on/off?)

# The goal is to maximize culmuative reward
