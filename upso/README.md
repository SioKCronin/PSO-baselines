# Unified PSO

# Unique Contribution
* Combining global and local best into a single algorithm.
* Mutation constant added to either Global or Local velocity update. 

### Performance

20 experiments were run for each function. Reported results were the percentage of runs that achieved the success goal, and the mean of the function evaluations required to achieve success ((number of particles * average number of iterations) / success rate)).
